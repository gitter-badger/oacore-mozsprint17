# Contributing to CORE @ Mozilla Global Sprint 2017

Thank you for your interest! 

CORE is aggregating 70 million research outputs and 7 million full text, we need your help to unleash the power of Open Access :)

We are looking for developer, data scientists, text miners, designers and testers to exploit as much as you want our dataset and APIs to increase the use and the visibility of Open Access in the world.
We have a list of ideas in the [issues](../../issues) section to get you started. Feel free to add more and more ideas to the issue tracker if you want.
In the following weeks we will continue making the issues growing with content and ideas.

## How to report bugs

Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. 

Most projects invite all contributors to report bugs, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at [Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
